        <h4>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT:  DIM EDGES ON EL LAMPS</h4>
        <p>Executed binary search strategies that found the Red X causing dim edges on electroluminescent (EL) lamps
          at an automotive customer. Installed a statistical control plan that permanently eliminated the root cause and
          drove the complaint to zero incidents.</p>
        <h4>NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION:  SUBSTRATE STICKING</h4>
        <p>New peel-off EL lamp product was sticking to its substrate. Isolated the cause to a chemical interaction with
          UV curing, but was unable to get to root cause.  Implemented a simple die-cutting solution that enabled lamp
          removal and allowed a high-yield, on-time launch.</p>
