        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Driver of performance, quality, and manufacturability for new and existing products</li>
          <li>Problem solver and risk reducer across multiple industries including electronics assembly and custom materials processing</li>
          <li>Successful leader of teams that achieved annual savings of more than $5M over 3 years</li>
          <li>Broad technical skills in DMAIC, Shainin Red X, and statistical analysis for process improvement and product development</li>
          <li>Fast learner of new technologies who makes positive contributions quickly</li>

          <p>PROJECT SHOWCASE</p>
        </div>
        <h4>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT:  DIM EDGES ON EL LAMPS</h4>
        <p>Executed binary search strategies that found the Red X causing dim edges on electroluminescent (EL) lamps
          at an automotive customer. Installed a statistical control plan that permanently eliminated the root cause and
          drove the complaint to zero incidents.</p>
        <h4>NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION:  SUBSTRATE STICKING</h4>
        <p>New peel-off EL lamp product was sticking to its substrate. Isolated the cause to a chemical interaction with
          UV curing, but was unable to get to root cause.  Implemented a simple die-cutting solution that enabled lamp
          removal and allowed a high-yield, on-time launch.</p>
