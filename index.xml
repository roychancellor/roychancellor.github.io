      <description>Projects on this page illustrate reactive and proactive problem solving projects I worked on either directly as a team leader or as an advisor to the primary project team. The project show how Shainin Red X and Green Y methods can quickly converge on the root cause of a technical problem.
Reactive Problem Solving Reactive problem solving occurs when a problem already exists and needs attention, whether it be for a line-down situation or to eliminate chronic problems.</description>

      <description>All of my personal projects can be found on GitHub. Below are some projects I am particularly proud of:
ProjectEuler Project Euler is a collection of challenging math problems solved with programming. I have used these problems for intellectual stimulation and to practice coding in Java. Archives of the problems are here.
 Find the first triangular number that has at least 500 divisors Problem #12 Find the first 10 digits of the sum of 100 fifty-digit numbers Problem #13 Find the number of paths through a 20 x 20 grid Problem #15 Find the sum of the digits in 2^1000 Problem #16 Total number of letters used to write out 1-1000 in words Problem #17 Find the sum of the digits in 100!</description>
