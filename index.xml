      <description>All of my personal projects can be found on GitHub. Below are some projects that I am particularly proud of:
Java Projects Programs written as part of the GCU Java Programming Certificate.
 Banking Application: Implements basic online-banking features as a web application using object-oriented concepts (abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism) using the MVC design pattern. Customer data and transactions are persistent in a SQL database with salted/hashed login credentials. Built using Java, Spring, MySQL, and JSP for web pages.</description>

      <description>Projects on this page illustrate reactive and proactive problem solving projects I worked on either directly as a team leader or as an advisor to the primary project team. The projects show how Shainin Red X and Green Y methods can quickly converge on the root cause of a technical problem.
Reactive Problem Solving Reactive problem solving occurs when a problem already exists and needs attention, whether it be for a line-down situation or to eliminate chronic problems.</description>
